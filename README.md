## Aim:
To apply Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App
## Algorithm:
1.Start

2.Select the target app (Netflix)

3.Identify competitor apps or websites

4.Define heuristic evaluation principles

5.Evaluate Netflix based on each heuristic

6.Identify and record usability issues

7.Assign severity ratings to each issue

8.Compare findings with competitor apps

9.Suggest possible improvements

10.Document all observations and analysis

11.Conclude the evaluation

12.End
## Output:
### Heuristic Evaluation Report – Netflix

This report presents a heuristic evaluation of the Netflix application and compares it with two major competitors—Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar. The goal is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses and recommend improvements to enhance the overall user experience.

### 1. Objective
The objective of this heuristic evaluation is to analyze Netflix's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) using Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and compare it with similar streaming platforms.

### 2. Competitors Selected
The evaluation compares Netflix with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar based on similar functionality and audience focus.

### 3. Methodology
A heuristic evaluation was conducted following Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics. Each app was assessed based on visibility of system status, consistency, error prevention, aesthetic design, and other principles.

### 4. Evaluation Criteria
The main heuristics considered include:

Visibility of system status

Consistency and standards

Error prevention

Aesthetic design

### 5. Heuristic Evaluation Summary

| Heuristic | Netflix | Amazon Prime Video | Disney+ Hotstar |
|------------|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Visibility of system status** | Smooth transitions and clear playback indicators | Slight delay in showing loading or buffering states | Clear playback but sometimes lag during load |
| **Consistency and standards** | Consistent across platforms | Mixed visual styles between mobile and web versions | Inconsistent button placements across sections |
| **Error prevention** | Confirms before removing from list; clear error messages | Occasional accidental removals without clear prompts | No confirmation before certain actions |
| **Aesthetic design** | Clean and minimal layout with dark theme | Slightly cluttered interface with mixed content blocks | Too many promotional banners and visual noise |

### 6. Key Findings
Netflix excels in maintaining consistency, clear system feedback, and a minimalist design. However, Prime Video shows minor inconsistencies and delays, while Hotstar’s interface suffers from clutter and confirmation issues. All platforms can improve personalization and content discoverability.

### 7. Recommendations

Add micro-interactions for better visual feedback during loading or errors.

Simplify navigation by reducing banners and redundant sections.

Ensure consistent UI patterns across all devices.

Introduce improved personalization and better onboarding tutorials.

### 8. Conclusion
Netflix offers one of the most refined and user-friendly experiences among streaming platforms. Minor enhancements in feedback and interactive design can further elevate user satisfaction. This evaluation demonstrates how continuous UX improvements are essential in maintaining user loyalty and engagement.
## Result:
The Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App is created and verified.
